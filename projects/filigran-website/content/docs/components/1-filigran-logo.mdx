# All filigran-ui icons :

<DisplayAllIcons />

## How to add icons to this catalog :

### Add icon to Figma :

- In the sheet where all icons are, right click > Plugin > Material Symbols

- Get your symbol from here, and then click on it. (you can add several ones)

- It is added to the Figma, but check that it is on **the same Layer** with other icons (#Filigran Icon) in the left panel.

- If it is not, you can drag&drop it in the correct layer.

### Launch the corresponding GitHub Action

- On gitHub, go to the "Actions" tab

- Launch the action called "Add svg Icons" (click on the Action Name, then you have a "Run workflow" button).

- It creates a pull request. You need to **merge** it to find the new icon on the Filigran-Website.
