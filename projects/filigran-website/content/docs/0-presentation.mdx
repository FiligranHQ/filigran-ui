# (ðŸš§WIP) Filigran-UI: Design System, Component and Icon library

Welcome to **Filigran-UI**, an evolving design system and component library built to standardize and unify the design and user experience across products developed by **Filigran**, a startup focused on cybersecurity solutions.

This project draws inspiration from popular libraries such as **Shadcn**, **RadixUI**, and **Tailwind CSS**, with the aim of offering a versatile set of UI components that can be used both with and without Tailwind CSS. Filigran-UI is designed primarily for React-based applications, but it also functions as a standalone component library for any web project.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

- **Repository:** [Filigran-UI GitHub Repository](https://github.com/FiligranHQ/filigran-ui)
- **Website:** A dedicated website that hosts both libraries
- **Filigran-UI:** Component library
- **Filigran-Icon:** Icon library

> **Note:** The work is currently in progress, and the project is not yet officially released.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of the Filigran Design System

The primary goal of the **Filigran Design System** is to ensure consistency, efficiency, and scalability across all user interfaces within Filigran's suite of cybersecurity tools. Here's why having a well-defined design system matters:

- **Consistency:** A design system ensures that every UI elementâ€”whether itâ€™s a button, form, or modalâ€”behaves and looks consistent across different products and platforms.
- **Efficiency:** By providing reusable components, developers and designers can save time, avoid reinventing the wheel, and focus on higher-level problems.
- **Scalability:** As Filigran's products grow, a unified design system ensures that new features and services can be added without sacrificing the coherence of the user experience.
- **Customization:** While it leverages Tailwind CSS for rapid development, Filigran-UI is flexible enough to be used as a standalone component library, enabling seamless integration into various projects, with or without Tailwind.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- **React Components:** The core components of Filigran-UI are built on React, providing an intuitive API and easy integration with React projects.
- **Tailwind-First, but Optional:** Although components are styled using **Tailwind CSS**, they are designed to work independently. This makes it possible to import components into projects that are not using Tailwind.
- **Inspired by Shadcn and RadixUI:** Components follow best practices from modern UI libraries, ensuring accessibility, responsiveness, and flexibility.
- **Filigran-Icon Library:** A growing collection of high-quality icons, designed to seamlessly integrate with Filigran's design system.
