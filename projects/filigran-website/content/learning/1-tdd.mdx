  # TDD for FizzBuzz: Step-by-Step Guide

  In this guide, we will solve the **FizzBuzz** problem using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**, which emphasizes writing tests before implementing functionality.

  ## What is FizzBuzz?

  The **FizzBuzz** problem requires printing numbers from 1 to 100, with the following rules:

  1. For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
  2. For multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
  3. For multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

  ## TDD Process Overview

  The TDD process follows a simple cycle, often referred to as **Red-Green-Refactor**:

  1. **Red**: Write a failing test.
  2. **Green**: Write just enough code to pass the test.
  3. **Refactor**: Clean up the code while ensuring all tests still pass.

  ## Step 1: Write the First Test (Print Numbers)

  ### Red: Write the Failing Test

  In this step, we will create a test to verify that the `fizzBuzz` function correctly prints numbers from 1 to 100.

  1. **Create a test file** named `fizzbuzz.test.js` if you haven't already.

  2. **Add the following code** to the test file:

  ```js

  test('prints numbers from 1 to 100', () => {
    const result = fizzbuzz();
    expect(result[0]).toBe(1);  // The first element should be 1
    expect(result[99]).toBe(100); // The last element should be 100
  });
  ```
  ### Green: Write the Minimum Code
  Implement the `fizzBuzz` function to make the test pass.

  ```js
  export const fizzbuzz = () => {
      const result = [];
      for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
      result.push(i);
    }
      return result;
    }
```

    </QuizzQuestionChoice>
    <QuizzExplanation>
      In TDD, the first step is to write a failing test before writing any code. This ensures that you're writing only the necessary code to make the test pass.

    ## Why do we write tests first in TDD?
    <QuizzQuestionChoice id="1">
      To ensure code correctness before implementation
    </QuizzQuestionChoice>
    <QuizzQuestionChoice id="2">
      To save time later

      To avoid bugs
    </QuizzQuestionChoice>
    <QuizzExplanation>
      Writing tests first helps ensure that the code meets requirements and works correctly before implementation, which leads to fewer errors and more maintainable code.

  # Exercise: Roman Numerals Converter

  ## Problem Statement:

  Write a function that converts an integer (between 1 and 3999) into its corresponding Roman numeral representation.

  ## Roman Numeral Rules:

  - Roman numerals are represented by seven symbols:
  - `I` - 1
  - `V` - 5
  - `X` - 10
  - `L` - 50
  - `C` - 100
  - `D` - 500
  - `M` - 1000

  - The following combinations are used to form numbers:
  - `II` - 2
  - `III` - 3
  - `IV` - 4 (5 - 1)
  - `VI` - 6 (5 + 1)
  - `IX` - 9 (10 - 1)
  - `XII` - 12 (10 + 2)
  - `XX` - 20
  - `XL` - 40 (50 - 10)
  - `LX` - 60 (50 + 10)
  - `XC` - 90 (100 - 10)
  - `CXX` - 120
  - `CD` - 400 (500 - 100)
  - `DC` - 600 (500 + 100)
  - `CM` - 900 (1000 - 100)
  - `MCMXC` - 1990 (1000 + 1000 - 100 + 1000 - 10)

  ## Input:

  - An integer `num` (1 ≤ `num` ≤ 3999).

  ## Output:

  - A string representing the Roman numeral equivalent of the input integer.

  ## Examples:

  1. **Input:** `3`
  **Output:** `"III"`

  2. **Input:** `4`
  **Output:** `"IV"`

  3. **Input:** `9`
  **Output:** `"IX"`

  4. **Input:** `58`
  **Output:** `"LVIII"`
  **Explanation:** L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.

  5. **Input:** `1994`
  **Output:** `"MCMXCIV"`
  **Explanation:** M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90, IV = 4.

  ## Task:

  1. **Write Failing Tests First (Red Phase):**
  - Start by writing unit tests for each conversion case.

  2. **Implement the Conversion Logic (Green Phase):**
  - Write the code that converts the integer to a Roman numeral to pass the tests.

  3. **Refactor the Code (Refactor Phase):**
  - Optimize the implementation without breaking the functionality as validated by the tests.
